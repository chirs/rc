Hi Brian. Things have changed since I talked to you last. 

I'll be spending 6 weeks at the start of 2017 at Recurse Center - a "writer's retreat for programmers" - exploring ideas at the intersection of programming and architecture, focusing on open source architecture.

I'd love to talk to you before I start on January 3 to get your thoughts on the state of things, on who else I would want to talk to, and in general to get some outside input before starting this project.

I'm happy to come and meet you anywhere, and I can come wherever is most convenient for you. I can also send you some introductory questions.



OSarc

1. What's the most important programming things that can be worked on to move this idea forward?
2. What's the most important non-programming things?
3. What are the dangers? [For me this idea seems like an almost unmitigated good.]
4. Why haven't we gotten anywhere? What are the major roadblocks to success?
5. What is the future? Where are we headed?
6. Who else should I talk to?
7. What other questions do I need to ask?
