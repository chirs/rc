A repo for my upcoming 6-week stint at Recurse Center


### What is architecture?

Wikipedia:

Architecture (Latin architectura, from the Greek ἀρχιτέκτων arkhitekton "architect", from ἀρχι- "chief" and τέκτων "builder") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements.

"Architecture" can mean:

A general term to describe buildings and other physical structures.[3]

The art and science of designing buildings and (some) nonbuilding structures.[3]

The style of design and method of construction of buildings and other physical structures.[3]

Knowledge of art, science, technology, and humanity.[3]

The practice of the architect, where architecture means offering or rendering professional services in connection with the design and construction of buildings, or built environments.[4]

The design activity of the architect,[3] from the macro-level (urban design, landscape architecture) to the micro-level (construction details and furniture).

Architecture has to do with planning and designing form, space and ambience to reflect functional, technical, social, environmental, and aesthetic considerations. It requires the creative manipulation and coordination of materials and technology, and of light and shadow. Often, conflicting requirements must be resolved. The practice of architecture also encompasses the pragmatic aspects of realizing buildings and structures, including scheduling, cost estimation and construction administration. Documentation produced by architects, typically drawings, plans and technical specifications, defines the structure and/or behavior of a building or other kind of system that is to be or has been constructed.

The word "architecture" has also been adopted to describe other designed systems, especially in information technology.[3]

### What am I going to do?

I'm going to work on the subject of open source architecture.

I'm going to work on the intersection of architecture and computer programming.





### Wikipedia

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_architecture

There's already a very healthy wikipedia article about this.

Some ideas:

open source architecture is vernacular architecture
open source architecture is current architecture using open source tools
open source architecture is...

"Cooking is often hailed as an early form of open source; vernacular architecture – producing recipes for everyday buildings – is another form of early lo-fi open-source culture, openly sharing and optimising technologies for building."

There is no copyright violation, because the original is an an open-source document, but it doesn't come close to being encyclopedic. Does anyone have any suggestions as to what we should do about this? --Guy Macon (talk) 08:55, 27 October 2012 (UTC)
